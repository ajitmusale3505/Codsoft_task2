# Codsoft_task2

"A user-friendly calculator application built with Python and the Tinker GUI toolkit. This project demonstrates fundamental GUI development concepts, including event handling, user input, and error management. Key features include basic arithmetic operations, advanced calculations (e.g., percentage, square root, factorial), and a clear, intuitive interface. By leveraging Python's Tkinter library and the Tinker framework, I gained practical experience in creating interactive and responsive applications. This project showcases my skills in Python programming, GUI development, and effective problem-solving."
